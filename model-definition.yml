    Creates a DTM of the chosen area of interest based on bounday input.

  description: >
   The CityCAT model relies on elevation data. This model accepts elevation data in .asc, .tif or .tiff format, clips the data to the
    selected area, and ensures all data is in the same projection. If the file sizes are too large, multiple files can be added directly, or zipped.
